## FAQ 

**Last Updated: 15 Feb 2025**

Some responses to questions I am often asked.  

## What are your system specs? 

I run a dual-boot of Fedora Linux and Windows 11 on a mid-range-ish desktop computer I've built that I call "Discovery". Frequently people think I must have some monstrously powerful computer, in reference to a few videos (link to [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbIiAr5dt24), & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmshJmQ6o90)) I've done where I've pointed out the speed of computers, but it really isn't so. Computers, just, in a very general kind of way, are very fast. My computer suits my needs, presently, and I'm happy with it. 

* **Name:** Discovery 
* **Processor:** Intel Core i5-12400F @ 4.4GHz (6 cores, 12 threads)
* **RAM:** 32GB Corsair
* **GPU:** RTX 3060 w. 12GB vRAM
* **Case:** [Fractal Design Focus 2 (White)](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/focus/focus-2/white-tg-clear-tint/)
* **Storage:** 1TB M.2, 1TB SATA 


## What is that terminal you're using? 

In some of my videos I've used [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term), a terminal emulator that emulates a CRT television. It might be silly, but I find it fun and reasonably aesthetically pleasing. Otherwise, I use xfce4-terminal, that comes with the XFCE desktop environment. On Windows, I simply use the default Windows terminal, sometimes with the CRT shader setting applied. 

## What is that font you're using? 

For my terminal and editor(s), I usually use any of a number of fonts from [The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/). I particularly like IBM BIOS-2y. 

## How does your desktop look like that?/What desktop environment do you use? 

I very much enjoy using [NsCDE](https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE). It's a modern version of the old [CDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment) desktop from the 90s, and I love it. I love to have a look that brings to mind an old Sun workstation, and NsCDE does that splendidly. 

## What keyboard do you use? 

I use a [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with [Glorious Panda switches](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches) and KBDFans SA profile Violet PBT keycaps. I like it, but it's a bit loud for my tastes. My next keyboard will be quieter. 

## What is the deal with the fibonacci program?/Can I have it?

It's a little program I wrote in C. It calculates the nth fibonacci number quickly and to an arbitrary level of precision using [GMP](https://gmplib.org/). 

You can download an updated version of it (with additions from others) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uK8MvlcJhOw5X9mDKA6e2SLcpWJ_NCLP?usp=drive_link). There is also an MS-DOS port, there. The original gist is [here](https://gist.github.com/Softwave/f61091aed8c8d8249014b5056447a698).
